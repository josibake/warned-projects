# CVE image tester

Tests that CVE images have been backported correctly and work with signet.

## For testers

Use one of the provided network templates. The first is meant to deploy all CVE images along with a v26 signet miner, and the second is meant for deploying a network of a single CVE version for troubleshooting.

You can run individual warnet commands or use the provided `signet_test_script.sh`, which deploys a network, creates a wallet for the miner, imports the descriptor, and mines a block.
